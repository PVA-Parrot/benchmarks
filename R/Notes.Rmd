```{r setup, include=FALSE}

```

Checked the PVA calculations against the reference implementation again.
Normalization of the data works as intended and is identical to the reference (range normalization).

However, eigenvalues and eigenvectors are still quite far off. Eigenvalues more so than eigenvectors.
I used `prcomp` as well as `eigen(cov(x))` which yield similar results but do not match the reference at all.
