	abstract = {The chemically and mineralogically zoned Topopah Spring silicic ash-flow
sheet (12.8 Ma, 1200 km 3) in the southwest Nevada volcanic
field (SWNVF) contains two pumice fragment populations, a lower silica
(LS) and a high-silica rhyolite (HSR) composition. Recent
interpretations are that these magmas, represented by the pumice
fragments, were not related by AFC processes within a single magma
chamber. The emplacement of the Pah Canyon ash-flow sheet followed the
Topopah Spring ash-flow sheet eruption. This smaller volume (˜ 35
km 3) ash-flow sheet contains pumice fragments that were
previously interpreted as a hybrid magma formed by mixing of residual
Topopah Spring LS and HSR magmas. Pumice fragments from these ash-flow
sheets were analyzed by polytopic vector analysis (PVA), a multivariate
statistical program that describes each sample in a dataset in terms of
some proportion of each end member generated by the program. Therefore
each sample, or pumice fragment, is uniquely described by some amount of
each of the end members so that graphical analysis of the dataset allows
the immediate recognition of separate magma batches, as pumice fragment
samples cluster in discrete groups and show different variations in end
member proportions. Recognition of hybrid magmas is also immediately
apparent, as pumice fragments representing mixed magmas must plot
between the parent magmas (pumice fragment groups). Our results confirm
the existence of independently generated magmas involved in the
formation of the Topopah Spring ash flow. However, PVA of Pah Canyon
pumice fragments reveals that Pah Canyon cannot be described solely as a
hybrid magma derived from Topopah Spring LS and HSR magmas. Furthermore,
Pah Canyon and the Topopah Spring HSR pumice fragments have identical
trends in the variation of end member proportions that most likely
represent crystal fractionation or accumulation in both magmas that was
previously undetected. This pattern is inconsistent with simple mixing
between the TS-LS and TS-HSR magmas. Rather it is consistent with magma
mixing followed by fractional crystallization.},

When end members are present in the sample set, the algorithm QMODEL by Klovan and Miesch can efficiently determine proportionate contributions. EXTENDED QMODEL by Full, Ehrlich, and Klovan was designed to deduce the composition of realistic end members when the end members are not represented by samples. However, in the presence of high levels of random variation or outliers not belonging to the system of interest, EXTENDED QMODEL may not be reliable inasmuch as it is largely dependent on extreme values for definition of an initial mixing polyhedron. FUZZY QMODEL utilizes the fuzzy c-means algorithm of Bezdek to provide an alternative initial mixing polyhedron. This algorithm utilizes the collective property of all the data rather than outliers and so can produce suitable solutions in the presence of noisy or “messy” data points.},

	abstract = {Fifty sediment cores, comprising a total of 194 individual samples, were collected throughout the Newark Bay Estuary including the Arthur Kill, Rahway River, Elizabeth River, Hackensack River, Kill van Kull, and Passaic River between November 1991 and March 1993. All samples were analyzed for polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs). An additional six to ten samples were collected from each core and analyzed for the radioisotopes 210Pb and 137Cs. The 210Pb and 137Cs results were used to estimate sediment accumulation rates for each core and approximate dates of sediment deposition for individual samples analyzed for PCDD/Fs. Sediment cores for which radioisotope results were inadequate for radiodating were excluded from the analysis, leaving a total of 26 cores, comprising 50 individual samples, for further statistical analysis. These remaining samples were grouped into three categories (models) based on their estimated dates of deposition. The time intervals represented by each model were 1950–1965 (model 5065), 1970–1979 (model 7079), and 1980–1989 (model 8089). Polytopic vector analysis (PVA) was performed separately on each model to determine the number of dominant fingerprint patterns (end members) present within each model. PVA results indicate that the 5065 model comprises five distinct end members, while the 7079 and 8089 models comprise six distinct end members. Comparison of end member patterns with source-specific fingerprint patterns found three PCDD/F congener patterns common to all models: combustion sources, sewage sludge sources, and sources associated with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). In addition, each of the three models contained more than one sewage sludge or combustion pattern as well as at least one pattern that could not be identified. In many cases, the location of specific land-based sources (i.e, combined sewer overflow (CSO) outfalls and PCB-contaminated sites) was consistent with the identified end members. For example, the highest proportion of the PCB source end member was present in a sample collected adjacent to a PCB-contaminated site on the lower Passaic River, and the highest proportions of the sewage sludge source end members were present in samples collected adjacent to CSO and sewage treatment plant outfalls. The combustion and sewage sludge source end members were present in relatively high proportions in nearly all samples. These results are consistent with a recent study of surface sediments from the same locations, which reported that atmospheric deposition (combustion), and CSO and wastewater treatment plant discharges (sewage sludge) were the dominant sources of PCDD/Fs to surface sediments. As with the subsurface sediments, the locations of known land-based sources are consistent with the end members identified in surface sediments such as the PCB-contaminated site identified in this analysis. This indicates that contaminants in subsurface sediments may not impact surface sediments and that for health risk assessment and risk management purposes, an emphasis should be placed on controlling on-going impacts to surface sediments from municipal and industrial discharges. The results of this study are consistent with recent findings reported by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency that combustion and incineration are the major sources of PCDD/Fs to the environment. CSOs provide a mechanism of transport for combustion/incineration-related PCDD/Fs as well as those associated with industries that discharge to the combined sewer system. Until combustion/incineration sources and CSO discharges are adequately controlled, they will remain a continuing and on-going source of PCDD/Fs to the surface sediments of the lower Passaic River.},

Sensitive isotopic and microchemical techniques can reveal subtle evidence of magma mixing in igneous rocks, but more robust statistical techniques for bulk chemical data can help evaluate complex mixing relationships. Polytopic vector  analysis (PVA) is a multivariate technique that can be used to evaluate suites of samples that are produced by mixing of two or more magma batches. The Papagayo Tuff of the  Miocene-Pleistocene Bagaces Formation in northern Costa Rica is associated with a segment of the Central American Volcanic Arc. While this segment of the arc is located on oceanic plateau, recent (\&lt;8 Ma) ignimbrites bear the chemical signatures of upper continental crust, marking the transition from oceanic to continental crust. The Papagayo Tuff contains banded pumice fragments consistent with one or more episodes of mixing/mingling to produce a single volcanic deposit. The PVA solution for the sample set is consistent with observations from bulk chemistry, microchemistry and petrographic data from the rocks. However, without PVA, the unequivocal identification of the three  end-member solution would not have been possible.},

The concentrations of 2,3,7,8-substituted PCDD/Fs were assayed in eighty-one surface and near-surface sediment samples collected from the Passaic River, Hackensack River, Arthur Kill, Elizabeth River, Kill Van Kull, Port Elizabeth, and Port Newark navigation channels and Robins Reef, which is located in New York Harbor. PVA modeling revealed five predominant 2,3,7,8-substituted PCDD/F fingerprint patterns in geographically plausible distributions throughout the estuary. This was consistent with the current understanding of hydrodynamic and sedimentation conditions reported in the literature for Newark Bay. Three patterns contained 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (2,3,7,8-TCDD), which is alleged to originate from a single industrial source on the lower Passaic River. One of the fingerprints containing 2,3,7,8-TCDD was present in moderate proportions (10–20\%) in surface sediments near the site, but was generally observed in low abundance ({\textless}5\%) elsewhere in the estuary. A fingerprint pattern characteristic of PCDD/F profiles in effluents from municipal sewage and waste water treatment plants was widely distributed in the estuary, but reached its highest relative proportions in the Elizabeth River. A third fingerprint pattern was highest in the Arthur Kill and lower Passaic River and closely matched the residue patterns found in several types of combustion sources. A fourth finger-print pattern in Hackensack River and lower Passaic River sediment matched the PCDD/F profile reported in PCB Aroclor® formulations. A fifth fingerprint pattern matched the profile in recycled pulp and paper mill effluents and was highest in Kill van Kull and upper Passaic River sediment. The majority of PCDD/Fs in sediment from Reaches B, C, and D of Port Newark and Port Elizabeth were attributable to sediments transported via the Arthur Kill and the Kill Van Kull. These results are consistent with those previously reported using principal components analysis, which indicated that 2,3,7,8-substituted PCDD/F patterns in the sediments of Newark Bay are consistent with discharges from multiple sources.},

	abstract = {Magma mixing and crystal fractionation are fundamental processes that lead to the diversity of magma compositions, but rarely are all of the major and trace element data on whole rocks used simultaneously in evaluating proposed models. Polytopic vector analysis (PVA) is an oblique factor analysis procedure designed specifically to evaluate mixing or unmixing (fractional crystallization) in geologic systems using all of the analytes (major and trace elements) simultaneously. It differs from other techniques in that it not only determines the number of end-members and their compositions, but also partitions the relative proportions of the end-members into each sample in the data array. These samples, expressed as proportions of end-members, can be used as input in other multivariate analyses. The purpose of this paper is to use PVA to evaluate some examples of magma mixing and fractional crystallization and use these examples as templates for more complicated systems in order to show both the strengths and the weaknesses of the approach. Five well-constrained examples illustrate how PVA can discriminate between these two processes and provide additional petrogenetic information. Using PVA, mixing between magma types can be easily distinguished from crystal fractionation. With fractional crystallization the end-members, generated by PVA, are the initial and final liquids and the compositions where new phases join the crystallizing assemblage.},
